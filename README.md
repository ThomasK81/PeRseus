# PeRseus

Perseus refers to the Perseus Digital Library (http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/), R stans for R. R also stands for recycling. PeRseus.R is an importer for PDL and OGL texts (https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin) that are citable via the CTS/CITE architecture (http://cite-architecture.github.io). It follows the principle that textual research is based on analysis and synthesis, effectively creating new tokenisations of the same text. Often those tokenisations are not saved. PeRseus attempts to save those tokenisations and make them citable, so they can be retrieved and reused (recycled) for new projects, research questions, tasks. The different tokenisations of the texts are saved as R binaries (.rds). PeRseus is wriiten in R and uses git's tree structure and github's api to retrieve the generated binaries.The development of PeRseus has just started and is open source (CC-by).
